# steam-code-copy
 A very simple program for automatically copying Steam 2FA code to clipboard with a single command

### Explanation
This is a very simple program I put together to make Steam logins easier. I am commonly switching between multiple Steam accounts, and found myself wasting a lot of time navigating to the Desktop Authenticator app, clicking copy and going back to the browser to paste the code.

#### Usage - compile and add to PATH
Compiled version not included as I don't want to be accused of anything. Simply run `pkg index.js` to compile the code, rename your platform's version to something simple, like `auth`, and place the file in your PATH. Then just run `auth` anywhere you want to get the 2FA code copied to your clipboard automatically. Hope the idea helps someone!
